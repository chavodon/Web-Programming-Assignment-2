# Web-Programming-Assignment-2
Second Assignment for Web Programming Module

From completing this assignment I had built on my webpage design knowledge using HTML. I incorporated external Javascript  as well as  css files. Also used other various HTML tags such as:
  - TR
  - TD
  - Form
  - Div
 
 I also made use of various CSS style attributes such as text alighment,  adjusting the margin or padding of elements, making use of borders and adding backgroud images for the webpages. Also made a javascript function to make calculations from user input.
